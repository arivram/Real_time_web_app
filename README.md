# Real_time_web_app
This repository contains a Python-based web application that visualizes real-time process data from bioreactors. The dashboard provides insights into key parameters such as temperature, pH, distilled oxygen, and pressure. The project aims to enhance the data monitoring capabilities of the bioreactor systems.
