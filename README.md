# Real_time_web_app
This repository contains a Python-based web application that visualizes real-time process data from bioreactors. The dashboard provides insights into key parameters such as temperature, pH, distilled oxygen, and pressure. The project aims to enhance the data monitoring capabilities of the bioreactor systems.

Minimum Viable Project
The primary objective of this project is to create a dashboard that allows users to plot the four key series (Temperature, pH, Distilled Oxygen, and Pressure) over time.

How to Run
To run the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Execute the following command:
"docker compose up"
6. Open your web browser and access the dashboard at http://localhost:8888/.
